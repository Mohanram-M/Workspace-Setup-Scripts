TVS Code provides several different scopes for settings. When you open a workspace, you will see at least the following two scopes:

* User Settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.

* Workspace Settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.

    - `Ctrl + , `  ( Open Settings ) 
    - `Ctrl + Shift + P`  ( Open Preferences )
